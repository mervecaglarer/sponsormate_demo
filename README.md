# SPONSORMATE

Many events or projects are planned in the world and in our country. Only a small part of the planned activities and projects can be implemented. The biggest common point of these events and projects that could not be realized is the lack of sponsor support to meet the required needs. This problem is generally caused by the fact that the event or project owners cannot reach the right companies or individuals or the companies sponsor events or projects that will not actually yield them and fill the sponsor quotas.

Sponsormate is an automation project that has been developed to minimize such problems with data mining and artificial intelligence algorithms. Sponsormate examines the sponsorship behavior of companies and tries to recommend companies that have a higher sponsorship to event hosts.
> Sponsormat project was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) .
